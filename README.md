## What this project is

**Sleeve Music Player** scans local audio files and turns them into a polished, tactile listening experience focused on:

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK installed
- Android SDK / emulator (recommended target)

### Run locally

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Basic quality checks

```bash
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

## Platform notes

- **Android:** primary platform and best-supported experience
- **Web:** playback works, but direct file/tag editing is limited by browser file access constraints
- **Linux:** not fully compatibility yet, I'm sure the app compiles and would work to some extent, but I plan to bring full support to Linux in the future.

## Permissions (Android)

- Music library access (`Permission.audio` / storage permission variants)
- Notification permission on Android 13+ for background media controls
- `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` may be required for certain metadata/tag write operations on newer Android versions

## Status

This project is actively being improved with UI refinements, playback reliability enhancements, and richer playlist/metadata workflows.
